This repository covers the work I am doing for Daniel's Table (DT).  DT is a
non-profit working to solve food insecurity.  While not very large, they are
a very innovative organization and have some interesting ideas on how to
work more efficiently to eliminate food insecurity in the United States.

Currently, I have one project going for them.

###donor_update

This project will help them more efficiently process the donations they
have received and manage thank you letters and fund-raising campaigns.
You can read about it in the _donor_updater.docx_ file in the docs directory.

I will probably move the docs directory to be inside the donor_update
directory at some point in the future.
